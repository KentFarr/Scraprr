"this year, i came into my school library and there are rows and rows of empty shelves with absolutely no books," said takata, who started grade 10 last week. she estimates more than 50 per cent of her school's library books are gone. in the spring, takata says students were told by staff that "if the shelves look emptier right now it's because we have to remove all books [published] prior to 2008." takata is one of several peel district school board (pdsb) students, parents and community members cbc toronto spoke to who are concerned about a seemingly inconsistent approach to a new equity-based book weeding process implemented by the board last spring in response to a provincial directive from the minister of education. they say the new process, intended to ensure library books are inclusive, appears to have led some schools to remove thousands of books solely because they were published in 2008 or earlier. the board did not address questions about empty shelves, the volume of books removed and reports about weeding books based on the date of publication. instead, the board issued statements explaining that the process of weeding books from school libraries was completed in june and has always been a part of teacher librarian responsibilities within pdsb and at school boards across the country. "books published prior to 2008 that are damaged, inaccurate, or do not have strong circulation data (are not being checked out by students) are removed," said the board in its statement. 244 replies / 58 imagesview thread 239 replies and 56 images omitted. click here to view. >> anonymous (id: hxxqvqhu) 09/14/23(thu)22:16:05 no.441307802 anonymous (id: hxxqvqhu) 09/14/23(thu)22:16:05 no.441307802 file: .jpg (1.59 mb, 1242x1552) 1.59 mb jpg >>441307570 >>oh no, this guy knows how to read, has critical thinking skills, and has a basic understanding of libraries. i better vaguely threaten and insult him. >> anonymous (id: hxxqvqhu) 09/14/23(thu)22:20:24 no.441308069 anonymous (id: hxxqvqhu) 09/14/23(thu)22:20:24 no.441308069 file: mental illness.jpg (657 kb, 2952x2240) 657 kb jpg reminder that leftards are mentally-ill and fundamentally evil. >> anonymous (id: lutkv8fz) 09/14/23(thu)22:29:10 no.441308679 anonymous (id: lutkv8fz) 09/14/23(thu)22:29:10 no.441308679 >>441235348 and then one day, for no reason at all, everyone elected hitler into power. >> anonymous (id: rn0do42t) 09/14/23(thu)22:31:26 no.441308847 anonymous (id: rn0do42t) 09/14/23(thu)22:31:26 no.441308847 >>441308679 then we have book burning of books published 2008 and after. >> anonymous (id: lutkv8fz) 09/14/23(thu)22:32:51 no.441308951 anonymous (id: lutkv8fz) 09/14/23(thu)22:32:51 no.441308951 >>441235348 >if the shelves look emptier right now it's because we have to remove all books [published] prior to 2008. oh i get it, (((they))) want to remove everything prior to the years before wokeism. got it. hope they get doxxed. judy tester (id: co/dyojs) 09/14/23(thu)14:24:21 no.441269598 file: another six million.jpg (60 kb, 498x460) 60 kb jpg judy tester (id: co/dyojs) 09/14/23(thu)14:24:21 no.441269598 [reply] jew mayor of sacramento trolled thoroughly when every single caller to online city council meeting calls him a kike https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1699854465841422336/vid/avc1/720x406/z4njvfxok8rmxjfy.mp4 273 replies / 69 imagesview thread 268 replies and 67 images omitted. click here to view. >> anonymous (id: uo0nfedt) 09/14/23(thu)22:30:42 no.441308796 anonymous (id: uo0nfedt) 09/14/23(thu)22:30:42 no.441308796 >>441308772 k >> anonymous (id: soimkopz) 09/14/23(thu)22:31:05 no.441308822 anonymous (id: soimkopz) 09/14/23(thu)22:31:05 no.441308822 >>441308705 i still don't get it. do you think shoobies incredibly heavy use of hard drugs has negatively impacted his ability to role play as a nazi?

first is with the lie that 'the good guy always wins.' completely false and bullshit. all the scum from my childhood who bullied and beat me are fuking doing 10x better than me. what about 'work hard and you will be successful.' i spent 4 years of my life and 100k in student debt studying, i got a job at a tech firm, only to be shunned for promotions constantly for stacy who spends more time recording tiktoks than actually working. and guess what? i have to pick up the fuking slack or my simp manager gives me the shit. i decide to go on a date to find my partner. each whore, even the 'good religious ones who go church every sunday' have more than 15 bodies at 25. they expect me to pay for everything on my mediocre salary which brings me to my next point of how everything is so expensive. i spend so much money on food and rent and other crap to survive and i live in a fucking dump. what's even the point? why do i continue to struggle? for what? all the guys who made my life hell and did everything they said you shouldn't do are doing just great. in every aspect of my life i am expected to take the short end of the stick and smile while doing it. i hate everything around me but i am too poor to escape. what's the point? do i live only to suffer? how the fuk do you bros do it? i am so over it. 31 replies / 5 imagesview thread 26 replies and 3 images omitted. click here

6ft) and instead of helping me my family accused me of being on drugs and called me skeletor. well one night i had a dream and i was a prototype jet pilot set to test out this new jet. got in and took off but the speed increased exponentially until i had left the atmosphere of earth. suddenly the moon zipped past, then jupiter, then the galaxy, and then the universe. i was not in control at all and as i flew into the infinite black void at infinite (yet meaningless) speeds i realized i was fucked, dead. there was nothing, no light just emptiness and i cried at how badly i'd fucked up and just prayed to go back home. after some time i gained my senses and below me were clouds and i thought oh my god i'm back! so i flew down into them but failed to realize the clouds were nebulous gas and the thrusters of the engine ignited a second big bang. the force of a universes creation exploded into me and i was annihilated so hard that somehow my spirit remained in reality. i had become a being of pure energy. ageless and with infinite possibilities i decided to set back off the way i came knowing one day i'd finally return to earth. and that's when i woke up. that same day i packed my shit, bought a plane ticket for america and left behind my so-called friends and family. this was 10 years ago. my dream made me realize the void was my suicide and regret for following through. the explosion was my rebirth. i killed myself in my hometown, cut of all contact and have never returned so it's like i'm dead. i struggled hard to survive here but i became who i was truly meant to be and no one would recognize me now. work hard got a good woman, not many friends but a thousand people know me and smile when they see me. never kill yourself. be reborn >> anonymous (id: 7g5gvmu5)

parker yockey completed and published imperium in 1948, he wrote a comparatively short sequel or pendant to his major work. this sequel, which he later entitled, the enemy of europe, is now lost, but he had his manuscript with him when he was in germany in 1953, and, after revising two passages to take account of events since 1948, he had it translated into german and printed at frankfurt-am-main in an edition of two hundred copies. yockey’s work displeased the jews, who accordingly ordered their henchmen to raid the printing plant, punish the printer, smash the types, and destroy all copies of the book. yockey escaped and fortunately had already sent several copies abroad, and it is from a photocopy of one of these that mr. francis has tried to restore yockey’s english text, so far as possible. i'll also include this amusing, classic-revilo footnote, just because: >a university professor told me that at a small party in his home for some of his colleagues and their wives, all americans, in the autumn of 1941, one of the men made some loud-mouthed statements, about some horrid passage in mein kampf. the host, having two copies at hand, gave one to his guest and translated from the other for the company. the men, understanding the nature of evidence, necessarily agreed, willingly or sullenly, that the anti-german propaganda was a total lie, but one of the women, in a state of hysteria, ran screaming across the room, snatched the book from her host's hands, and began to rip out the pages, yelling that people who published such books should be killed. the insane woman was brought under control, but her fit necessarily ended what could have been a pleasant evening. less spectacular manifestations of irrationality were not uncommon. >> anonymous (id: 23fr1k+m)

leviathan & hobbes' other works. wouldn't say that hoppe is a monarchist: hoppe has too many tocquevillist reservations about monarchy. he simply considers it the lesser evil. thomas hobbes the core of rebellion – the universities >the core of rebellion, as you have seen by this, and read of other rebellions, are the universities; which nevertheless are not to be cast away, but to be better disciplined: that is to say, that the politics there taught be made to be, as true politics should be, such as are fit to make men know, that it is their duty to obey all laws whatsoever that shall by the authority of the king be enacted, till by the same authority they shall be repealed; such as are fit to make men understand, that the civil laws are god’s laws, as they that make them are by god appointed to make them and to make men know, that the people and the church are one thing, and have but one head, the king; and that no man has title to govern under him, that has it not from him; that the king owes his crown to god only, and to no man, ecclesiastic or other; and that the religion they teach there, be a quiet waiting for the coming again of our blessed saviour, and in the mean time a resolution to obey the king’s laws, which also are god’s laws >therefore i despair of any lasting peace amongst ourselves, till the universities here shall bend and direct their studies to the settling of it, that is, to the teaching of absolute obedience to the laws of the king, and to his public edicts under the great seal of england. for i make no doubt, but that solid reason, backed with the authority of so many learned men, will more prevail for the keeping of us in peace within ourselves, than any victory can do over the rebels. but i am afraid that it is impossible to bring the universities to such a compliance with the actions of state, as is necessary for the business. anonymous (id: xndallc0) 09/14/23(thu)22:31:44 no.441308868 file: 1690603054072686.png (439 kb,

this nonprofit thinks so. the rows of white canvas cabin tents newly erected in an out-of-the-way quarter of culver city, along the bank of ballona creek, have the ambiance of an army field base. miles to the east in south los angeles, more modest camping tents — like one might buy at a sporting goods store — line the parking lot of the shuttered lincoln theater, evoking something more like a boy scout jamboree. though dissimilar in style, the two tent villages have a common purpose: they’re the easiest step from the deprivations and hazards of the street to a place where meals are served three times daily and guards are on duty around the clock. the camps are managed by urban alchemy, the san francisco-based nonprofit that has rapidly grown into a multimillion-dollar street services enterprise and embodies an elastic philosophy of shelter. urban alchemy calls them safe sleep villages. westbrooks said the proposal faced some community opposition but was sold on the promise that urban alchemy would do outreach to recruit people living in encampments in the neighborhood. comment too long. click here to view the full text. 31 replies / 7 imagesview thread 26 replies and 7 images omitted. click here to view. >> anonymous (id: vegbragh) 09/14/23(thu)22:16:52 no.441307856 anonymous (id: vegbragh) 09/14/23(thu)22:16:52 no.441307856 >>441307019 onions green is people!!! >> anonymous (id: uz7q+3ae) 09/14/23(thu)22:18:03 no.441307927 anonymous (id: uz7q+3ae) 09/14/23(thu)22:18:03 no.441307927 >>441306119 there was one near my hometown that they just restored as a tourist attraction. its so restored that all it needs is some guards and it would be operational >> anonymous (id: kxhjfosn) 09/14/23(thu)22:19:05 no.441307994 anonymous (id: kxhjfosn) 09/14/23(thu)22:19:05 no.441307994 >>441305259 so much open space to fill with empties, used needles, garbage and human shit >> anonymous (id: zwk6t2xg) 09/14/23(thu)22:19:55 no.441308043 anonymous (id: zwk6t2xg) 09/14/23(thu)22:19:55 no.441308043 the camps are managed by urban alchemy, the san francisco-based nonprofit that has rapidly grown into a multimillion-dollar street services enterprise. https://urban-alchemy.us/ >> anonymous (id: uz7q+3ae) 09/14/23(thu)22:26:11 no.441308454 anonymous (id: uz7q+3ae) 09/14/23(thu)22:26:11 no.441308454 >>441307697 lets start a rumor that theirs an ebola outbreak there anonymous 09/14/23(thu)16:25:16 no.441302320 file: 1694700999937279.webm (3.92 mb, 720x1280) 3.92 mb webm anonymous 09/14/23(thu)16:25:16 no.441302320 [reply] how has diversity benefited your country?

09/14/23(thu)21:44:34 no.441305845 [reply] but after years working inside the government's department of historical authenticity, i can no longer remain silent. we've been taught that the pyramids were constructed by the ancient egyptians as tombs. wrong. evidence from "project amaranthine" proves that they were, in fact, massive energy amplifiers, designed to harness a mysterious cosmic power source we've yet to understand fully. during my tenure, i stumbled upon thousands of documents detailing clandestine expeditions to the pyramids, led by the world's top scientists. they discovered an unknown type of crystalline substance deep inside the pyramids, which pulses with an unusual energy. more disturbing? every major global event from the past century aligns with the fluctuation of this energy. the 2008 financial crisis? a blip in the energy. major shifts in global powers? directly tied to this pyramid energy. now, here's where it gets wild. we've been diverting billions from public funds to harness this energy, and the ultimate plan? to control global weather patterns, effectively holding the world hostage. imagine controlling every nation's agriculture, water supply, and even natural disasters! i'm putting everything on the line to share this. the truth about our history, our government, and the unimaginable power the pyramids hold, must come to light. share this information, don't let my risk be in vain. 7 replies / 2 imagesview thread 2 replies and 1 image omitted. click here to view. >> anonymous (id: osfqrg9g) 09/14/23(thu)21:47:21 no.441306032 anonymous

although, that being said, vietcong were also pretty tiny but still managed to do a number on our boys and eventually win the war against us. being smaller does offer some advantages in warfare: 1) you're a smaller target 2) you can more easily navigate tight places, like tunnels. the disadvantages are just that you can't carry as much gear and you're probably worse at melee combat, but these things aren't much relevant in modern warfare. so an army of manlets really isn't at any meaningful disadvantage against an army of 6ft chads. the 6ft chads are just going to be larger targets for shrapnel and bullets and have a harder time in tunnels, etc. the 6ft chads would win in medieval warfare of vikings swinging huge axes and swords, but those days are long gone. nowadays the manlets reign supreme. anonymous (id: pk/jscgx) 09/14/23(thu)21:08:36 no.441303361 file: fad9e57b-cf3f-4c4f-a2b3-d(...).jpg (33 kb, 450x293) 33 kb jpg anonymous (id: pk/jscgx) 09/14/23(thu)21:08:36
